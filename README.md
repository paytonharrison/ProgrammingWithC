# ProgrammingWithC
All of the labs created for MSU's CSCI 112 course taken in the Fall of 2018

Here is a description of each c file:

# Lab 0 - 
Basic "Hello World" introduction program

# Lab 1 - 
Converts a number from feet to miles

# Lab 2 -
Caluculates a house cost after 5 years based on initial house cost, annual fuel cost, and tax rate

# Lab 3 - 
Scans numbers from a text file and stores them in an array. Program then calculates the min, max, average, range, and standard deviation of the numbers
 
# Lab 4 -
Takes in two arrays that the program stores as (x,y) coordinates. The coordinates form a polygon, and the program calculates the area of the polygon

# Lab 5 - 
Reads in characters from a text file and stores them in a char array. Program then sorts characters in alphabetical order using selection sort

# Lab 6 - 
Asks the user to input a word. The program then figures out what the plural of the plural form of the word is (for example, changes "fly" to "flies," "bench" to "benches," etc.

# Lab 7 - 
Asks the user to input a word. The program then determines whether or not the input word is a palindrome using a recursive method

# Program 1 - Partner lab -
